In order to use Vanilla's Solr plugin you must configure Solr on your server first. There is a good tutorial here:

The configuration files in this folder are only a guideline and must be modified to suit your purposes. If you want to use these configuration files then you can do the following:

1. Place the configuration files in their proper locations.
2. Edit solrconfig.xml and change #PATH_TO_CONFIG# to point to the location of data-config.xml
3. Edit data-config.xml and add your database connection information.
